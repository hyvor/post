	</div>
	<p>
		Hyvor Post is the third product we've built at Hyvor. Before this, we tried just about every newsletter platform out there — Solution 1, 2, 3… you name it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here’s what we found:

		One was too busy raising money (felt like finding help in a haystack).
		Another lacked basic features we needed.
		And almost all of them kept increasing prices — even for the most basic things like adding a team member.
		So we decided to build our own.
		A tool that does one thing — and does it really well:
		Sending newsletters, simply.
	</p>

	<p>
		What makes it different? Most email platforms charge per subscriber, push you to upgrade for “premium” basics, and surprise you with extra fees.
Not here. With Hyvor Post, you pay only based on how many emails you send. That’s it. No sneaky upgrades, no surprises.
	</p>

	<p>
		We don’t just say we care about privacy — we design around it.
You own your email list. Everything is GDPR-compliant. No funny business.
	</p>

	<p>
		We're a small, bootstrapped team that cares deeply about our users.
You can always reach us directly — no support tickets lost in limbo.m
	</p>

	<p>

If you’re tired of bloated tools, complicated pricing, or being just another number on a VC-backed platform,
come join us. Let’s build something better, together.
	</p>

	<p>
		Warmly,
The Hyvor Team

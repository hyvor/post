<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hi there 👋</p>

<p>
	Welcome to Hyvor Post, a simple newsletter platform built with one goal in mind: <strong
		>sending newsletters without tracking users</strong
	>.
</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>
	To get started, you can sign up at the <a href="/console">Console</a>, which is where you will
	manage your newsletters, subscribers, and settings.
</p>

<h2 id="why-privacy">Why Privacy?</h2>

<p>
	At HYVOR, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right. In today's digital age, where data is
	often exploited for profit, we wanted to create a platform that respects user privacy and
	provides a simple, effective way to manage newsletters without intrusive tracking.
</p>

<p>
	There is an increasing number of creators and businesses who want to communicate with their
	audience without compromising their privacy. Hyvor Post is our answer to that need.
</p>

<h3 id="no-tracking">No Tracking</h3>

<p>
	Open & click tracking is standard in the industry. However, most users are not aware of the
	extent of tracking involved. This type of tracking can reveal sensitive information about users,
	such as their interests, behaviors, and even location. In Hyvor Post, we have completely
	eliminated open & click tracking. There is no hidden switch to turn on tracking. If it's a
	newsletter running on Hyvor Post, users can be assured that there is no tracking.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> August, 2024 </strong>: Launched a minimal newsletter feature in Hyvor Talk. This
		was helpful for our team to understand the newsletter industry and its requirements. We
		learned that privacy and simplicity are problems worth solving.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> January, 2025 </strong>: Started developing Hyvor Post as a standalone product.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> May, 2025 </strong>: Realized that relying on a third-party email service provider
		(ESP) would compromise our commitment to privacy. Decided to build our own email delivery
		system to ensure complete control over user data and privacy. This was a significant
		undertaking, but it was essential to stay true to our values.
		<a href="https://relay.hyvor.com">Hyvor Relay</a>, an open-source email delivery system, was
		born.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> November, 2025 </strong>: Launched Hyvor Post.
